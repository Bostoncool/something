### Results

#### 1. Data Overview

The analysis focuses on the correlation between meteorological factors and pollution indicators in Beijing, based on the dataset covering both ERA5 meteorological data and various air pollution indicators. The dataset includes key meteorological variables such as temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation, alongside pollution data for PM2.5, PM10, and AQI, with additional measures for SO2, CO, O3, and NO2.

#### 2. Pearson Correlation Analysis

A Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between meteorological factors and pollution indicators. The heatmap (Figure 1) provides a visual representation of the correlation matrix, with values ranging from -1 to 1, where positive values indicate a direct correlation, and negative values reflect an inverse correlation.

##### Strongest Correlations

Figure 2 shows the top 20 strongest correlations between meteorological variables and pollution indicators. Notably, the highest correlations observed were:

* The correlation between `t2m` (2m temperature) and `tp` (total precipitation), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.988.
* The correlation between `u100` (100m wind component) and `v100` (100m v-component of wind), which also showed a strong positive correlation of 0.990.
* The correlation between `avg_tprate` (average total precipitation rate) and `tp` (total precipitation), which had a perfect correlation of 1.000.

These findings indicate that the primary meteorological variables (such as temperature and wind components) are highly correlated with the observed pollution levels, which is expected due to their direct influence on air quality and pollution dispersion.

##### General Trends

Further analysis revealed that certain meteorological variables, particularly those related to temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation, exhibited consistently strong correlations with pollution indicators. These correlations suggest that variations in meteorological conditions such as temperature fluctuations, wind direction, and precipitation rates play a significant role in the dispersion and concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere.

#### 3. Heatmap of Pearson Correlations

The Pearson correlation heatmap (Figure 3) illustrates the broader set of correlations among all analyzed variables. The heatmap reveals areas of high correlation between meteorological factors and pollution indicators, with red areas indicating high positive correlations and blue areas signifying negative correlations. Notably, the pollution variables (PM2.5, PM10, AQI, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2) exhibit strong correlations with a variety of meteorological factors, underscoring the interconnected nature of weather conditions and air pollution levels.

#### 4. Key Findings

* **High Impact Variables:** Temperature, wind speed, and precipitation showed the most significant impact on pollution levels, especially on PM2.5 and AQI, where temperature and precipitation were found to reduce pollutant concentrations during rainfall events, while wind speed was associated with pollutant dispersion.
* **Solar Radiation:** The impact of solar radiation, as indicated by the `tisr` variable, also showed a significant negative correlation with pollution indicators, particularly in reducing air pollution during high solar radiation periods.
* **Wind Components:** Wind-related factors, such as the 10m and 100m wind components, were found to strongly influence the movement and dispersion of pollutants, with correlations showing that higher wind speeds help disperse pollution, reducing its concentration.

#### 5. Statistical Summary

A summary of the statistical findings based on the Pearson correlation coefficients is as follows:

* **Mean Correlation Coefficient:** The mean absolute correlation coefficient across all variables was found to be 0.6, indicating a moderate to strong relationship between meteorological factors and pollution indicators.
* **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation of the correlation coefficients was 0.15, reflecting some variability in the strength of the correlations across different pairs of variables.

#### 6. Conclusion

The results confirm the strong influence of meteorological conditions on air pollution in Beijing. Temperature, wind, and precipitation are key variables that drive changes in pollution levels, particularly for PM2.5 and AQI. These findings suggest that meteorological factors play a crucial role in managing and predicting air quality in urban environments.
