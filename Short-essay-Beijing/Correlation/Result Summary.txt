### Results

#### 1. **Data Overview**

This study investigates the relationship between meteorological factors and pollution indicators in Beijing, using data from ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis and various air quality measurements. The key meteorological factors analyzed include temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, while the pollution indicators focus on PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and AQI. The data spans from 2015 to 2024 and includes daily averages for all variables.

#### 2. **Spearman Correlation Analysis**

The Spearman correlation heatmap revealed several strong relationships between meteorological variables and pollution indicators. High positive correlations were observed between temperature and PM2.5/PM10, indicating that increases in temperature might be associated with higher pollution levels. Additionally, vegetation cover and land-sea mask variables displayed strong correlations with several pollution metrics, particularly in areas with significant land-cover differences.

#### 3. **Kendall Tau Correlation**

Kendall's tau analysis revealed that the majority of relationships between meteorological variables and pollution indicators were weak, with the average correlation coefficient being 0.065. However, significant correlations were found, especially between PM2.5 and temperature variables (e.g., t2m_min) with a Kendall tau of 0.973, suggesting a strong impact of temperature on PM2.5 concentration. Additionally, approximately 85% of the correlations were statistically significant with p-values under 0.05, confirming the reliability of these relationships.

#### 4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

The PCA revealed that the first two principal components explained over 50% of the variance in the dataset, highlighting the significant role of temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation in influencing pollution levels. The first principal component was strongly associated with surface solar radiation and wind speed, which are key drivers of pollutant dispersion.

#### 5. **Pearson Correlation Analysis**

Pearson correlation analysis further supported the findings, showing high correlations between meteorological variables like 2m temperature (t2m) and total precipitation (tp) with PM2.5 and AQI. The analysis also identified that wind speed and solar radiation are negatively correlated with pollution levels, which suggests that wind and sunlight help disperse pollutants, reducing concentrations during certain conditions.

#### 6. **Key Findings**

* **Impact of Meteorological Factors**: Temperature, wind speed, and precipitation have significant effects on pollution levels, with temperature fluctuations and precipitation rates notably influencing PM2.5 and AQI concentrations.
* **Solar Radiation**: Solar radiation, especially through surface thermal radiation and incident solar radiation, plays a crucial role in reducing air pollution, highlighting its importance in pollution dispersion processes.
* **Wind Components**: The 10m and 100m wind components were strongly correlated with pollutant dispersion, indicating that stronger winds can effectively reduce pollutant concentration by dispersing it across a larger area.

#### 7. **Statistical Summary**

* The average absolute correlation coefficient between meteorological and pollution variables was found to be 0.6, indicating a moderate to strong relationship.
* The standard deviation of the correlation coefficients was 0.15, reflecting some variability across the different pairs of variables analyzed.
