Based on the data and code provided, here’s a summary and analysis of the research:

### 1. **Data Overview**:

The dataset is based on meteorological data from the ERA-5 reanalysis, which includes various climate variables at high spatial and temporal resolution. The dataset covers the period from 2015 to 2024 and focuses on the Beijing area, with a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25° and a daily temporal resolution.

### 2. **Key Meteorological Variables**:

The key meteorological variables being analyzed include:

* **Temperature**: 2m temperature, dewpoint temperature, and minimum 2m temperature.
* **Wind Speed**: Both 10m and 100m wind speeds are included, computed from the U and V components of wind.
* **Precipitation**: Total precipitation and mean precipitation rate.
* **Boundary Layer Height**: A key factor for understanding atmospheric conditions.
* Additional variables like vegetation cover, snow depth, surface pressure, and solar radiation are also available.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**:

The preprocessing steps involved:

* **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and anomalies using Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Numpy).
* **Unit Conversion**: Converting temperature from Kelvin to Celsius for better interpretability.
* **Time Aggregation**: Converting hourly data to daily averages, a necessary step for the analysis of long-term trends.

### 4. **Analysis Focus**:

The analysis focuses on the following key aspects:

* **Time Series Plots**:
  The time series of **wind speed** and **temperature** have been plotted for the 10m and 100m heights. The temperature plot shows seasonal fluctuations with significant peaks during the summer months, while the wind speed plot reveals more volatile fluctuations, particularly at the 100m height.

  * **Temperature Analysis**:

    * The **2m temperature** shows a clear seasonal pattern with hotter summers and colder winters, characteristic of Beijing's climate.
    * The **dewpoint temperature** and **minimum temperature** also reflect seasonal patterns, with notable drops in winter.
    * The statistical analysis of these variables reveals the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values, giving insights into seasonal and overall temperature trends.

* **Wind Speed Distribution**:
  The histograms of wind speeds for both 10m and 100m heights provide insight into the distribution. At both heights, the wind speeds are more concentrated in the lower ranges (below 1.5 m/s), with rare occurrences of very high wind speeds.

* **Precipitation**:

  * The **precipitation time series** illustrates sporadic heavy rainfall events, with some peaks during the summer months.
  * The **mean precipitation rate** is visualized to show how precipitation intensity fluctuates over time, with the highest rates occurring during the summer monsoon season.

* **Seasonal Analysis**:
  Boxplots have been used to analyze the seasonal distributions of temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and boundary layer height. This analysis highlights seasonal patterns:

  * **Temperature**: Coldest during winter and warmest in summer.
  * **Wind Speed**: Generally higher in winter.
  * **Precipitation**: Highest in summer, with a marked decrease in winter.
  * **Boundary Layer Height**: Shows the highest variability in summer.

### 5. **Statistical Summary**:

The dataset is summarized with key statistical measures such as the mean, standard deviation, and extremes (max and min) for the various meteorological parameters. This summary provides a detailed view of how each variable behaves over time.

### Conclusion:

The analysis provides a comprehensive look at the meteorological conditions in Beijing over the last decade, with a focus on temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and boundary layer height. The seasonal patterns observed are typical for the region, with summer heat and precipitation, and winter cold and low precipitation. The wind speed shows a more variable pattern, influenced by both seasonal changes and possibly local topography. This data can be valuable for further studies on air pollution and climate modeling, especially with respect to its influence on PM2.5 levels and other pollutants in Beijing.
