Based on the data provided and the analysis outputs, here are some key observations:

1. **PM2.5 Concentration Histogram**:

   * The PM2.5 concentration in Beijing has a skewed distribution, with a majority of readings concentrated at lower levels.
   * The **mean PM2.5 concentration** is **48.03 μg/m³**, and the **median** is **31.10 μg/m³**, which indicates that the concentration is not symmetrically distributed, with some higher extremes.
   * The concentration frequently falls in the **"Good" (≤35 μg/m³)** and **"Moderate" (≤75 μg/m³)** categories, though there are significant numbers of higher pollution readings.
   * Lines representing various pollution thresholds (light, moderate, heavy, severe) help categorize the distribution into air quality levels.

2. **Air Quality Level Distribution**:

   * Most of the time, the air quality in Beijing is categorized as **"Good" (54.9%)** and **"Moderate" (28.5%)** based on PM2.5 concentrations.
   * **Light Pollution** accounts for about **10.5%**, and **Heavy Pollution** is relatively rare but still notable at **4.0%**.
   * **Severe Pollution** occurs in about **2.4%** of the time, highlighting days with extremely high PM2.5 values.

3. **Time Series Plot**:

   * The PM2.5 concentration shows significant variability over time, with noticeable spikes during certain periods, likely due to seasonal changes and other pollution events.
   * The **24-hour moving average** is included to smooth out the fluctuations, making it easier to spot long-term trends.
   * Reference lines for various pollution levels also provide a clear picture of how the concentrations vary relative to air quality standards.

Overall, the analysis of Beijing's PM2.5 data demonstrates significant pollution variability, with most periods in the **Good** to **Moderate** ranges, but notable periods of high pollution, particularly during certain times of the year. This information can be crucial for understanding pollution trends and informing air quality management strategies.
