Based on the data and code you provided, the analysis focuses on key meteorological variables for Beijing, including temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and boundary layer height, as observed from ERA5 NetCDF datasets. Below is a summary of the findings:

### Temperature Analysis:

1. **2m Temperature**: The data shows distinct seasonal variation in the 2m temperature, with the highest values observed in summer and the lowest in winter. The temperature fluctuates around the mean, with notable spikes in summer, particularly from 2020 to 2022.
2. **Dewpoint Temperature (2m)**: Similar seasonal patterns to the 2m temperature are observed for dewpoint temperature, which is generally lower than the air temperature.
3. **Minimum 2m Temperature**: This shows the lowest recorded temperatures, particularly in winter months, aligning with the seasonal drop.

### Wind Speed:

1. **10m Wind Speed**: Wind speed at 10m fluctuates throughout the years, with certain peaks in 2018-2019. Overall, the wind is stronger in the winter months, with a higher frequency of stronger winds during winter compared to other seasons.
2. **100m Wind Speed**: The trends are similar to the 10m wind speed but with more significant variations, especially during strong wind events.

### Precipitation:

1. **Total Precipitation**: There is a marked increase in precipitation during summer and autumn, especially in 2020 and 2021. This likely corresponds to the monsoon season.
2. **Mean Precipitation Rate**: This metric indicates periodic spikes in precipitation during specific months, especially in the rainy seasons.

### Boundary Layer Height:

1. **Boundary Layer Height**: The boundary layer height fluctuates seasonally, with lower values in winter and higher values in summer. This indicates a more stable atmosphere during winter, with stronger convection in summer.

### Seasonal Distribution:

* **2m Temperature**: There is a clear seasonal variation, with the highest temperatures in summer and the lowest in winter.
* **Wind Speed**: Wind speeds show seasonal peaks, especially at 100m during the winter months.
* **Precipitation**: Summer and autumn experience the highest precipitation, while winter remains the driest season.
* **Boundary Layer Height**: Generally higher in summer due to increased solar heating, and lower in winter when atmospheric mixing is more limited.

These analyses provide insights into the climatological variations in Beijing, which can be crucial for understanding air pollution patterns, as temperature inversions and stable atmospheric conditions in winter can enhance the persistence of pollutants like PM2.5.
