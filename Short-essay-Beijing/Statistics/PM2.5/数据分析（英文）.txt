Based on the analysis of the provided code, data, and graphical outputs, here is a concise summary of your research findings:

1. **PM2.5 Concentration Analysis**:

   * The analysis is based on data from Beijing, spanning from 2015 to 2024. The main pollutant in focus is PM2.5 (fine particulate matter), which is affected by multiple meteorological and surface variables.
   * The PM2.5 data are aggregated into hourly measurements, and the concentration distribution is visualized using histograms, time series plots, and pie charts.

2. **Air Quality Level Distribution**:

   * The pie chart displays the distribution of air quality levels based on PM2.5 concentrations. The majority of the hours are categorized as **Good** (54.6%) or **Moderate** (26.3%), with a small proportion falling into **Light Pollution** (10.1%), **Heavy Pollution** (4.0%), and **Severe Pollution** (1.1%).
   * This suggests that while Beijing's air quality is generally acceptable, there are significant pollution events, especially during specific periods.

3. **PM2.5 Concentration Histogram**:

   * The histogram provides a clear view of the PM2.5 concentration distribution, showing a skewed pattern where most values are low, with occasional spikes representing pollution events.
   * Statistical markers, including the mean and median, highlight the central tendency of the distribution. The concentration thresholds for different pollution levels (Good, Moderate, Light, etc.) are also indicated on the histogram.

4. **PM2.5 Time Series Analysis**:

   * The time series plot tracks the hourly PM2.5 concentration over several years, showing periods of rapid changes in pollution levels, typically driven by weather or local events.
   * Reference lines for various air quality thresholds (Good/Moderate Boundary, Light Pollution, etc.) are overlaid to contextualize pollution events.

5. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * The data preparation process involves handling missing values, replacing outliers, and ensuring the data quality according to environmental standards. This preprocessing ensures that the data is robust for further analysis and model training.

6. **Insights and Conclusion**:

   * The study provides insights into the long-term air quality trends in Beijing, identifying periods of heavy pollution. Despite regular moderate air quality, the occasional severe pollution events highlight the need for ongoing air quality management.
   * The findings suggest a direct correlation between PM2.5 concentration and local weather conditions, as indicated by the included meteorological variables such as wind speed, temperature, and pressure.

This analysis highlights the importance of monitoring air quality and its impact on public health, contributing valuable information to the ongoing efforts to combat pollution in urban areas like Beijing.
